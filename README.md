# CS 146 – Homework 4

This repository contains my solutions for Homework 4.

## Assignment 1 – Linked List Operations
Implemented a singly linked list with:
- Node class (int key + next pointer)
- listInsert (insert at head)
- listSearch (search by key)
- listDelete (delete by reference)

The main method creates a list, inserts three nodes, searches for one, deletes it, and prints the updated list.

## Assignment 2 – Palindrome Linked List
Checks whether a singly linked list is a palindrome using:
- Slow/fast pointer to find the middle
- Reversal of the second half
- Comparison of both halves

## Assignment 3 – Trapped Rainwater
Calculates trapped water in an elevation map using the two-pointer method.

Example input:
{1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 0, 2, 1, 5}

Output:
26 units

All programs were compiled and tested using the Java command line.
